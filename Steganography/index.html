            <h1>Steganography</h1>
            <p>The word <strong>Steganography</strong> is a technique which allows you to hide secret messages and files inside of an image. The word steganography comes from the Greek word steganos meaning to 'cover' or 'hide'.</p>

            <h2>How does it work?</h2>
            <p>Steganography often uses the 'Least Significant Bit' or LSB. You would probably know that every image is made up of pixels and each pixel would be a different colour. The computer will read each value of a pixel in binary and what steganography does is it slightly changes the values in each pixel in order to hide the secret message. Since this technique uses pixels, the bigger the message you want to hide, the bigger the image will have to be.</p>
